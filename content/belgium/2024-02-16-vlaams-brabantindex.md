Even though Diest is just across the border in the east of Vlaamse Brabant, it has already different characteristics from Limburg. It looks much richer. This wealth means that they have gorgeous palaces inside the town - but it also means brusselization. This how the Historical Dictionary of Brussels this phenomenon:
> **BRUSSELIZATION.**
the indiscriminate and careless introduction of modern high-rise buildings into gentrified neighborhoods


This specialty has now spread outside Brussels and conquered some flemish territories. That is why it is common to see during the train ride villages in the middle of nowhere consisting of just a few newly built box houses and gorgeous villas. But sadly it seems the former starts to dominate.

This disunity in architecture fails to create an enriching atmosphere and rather leaves the impression of chaos behind. And this poorer quality is not only present in the buildings but also in the local stores and services. For instance, next to the unique Brabant-style church on the main square only cringe kiosks and low-quality cafés could be found, which were completely empty. We got hopeful when we spotted a "bookhandel" titled store, but this initial enthusiasm declined drastically after we took our first breath. It was rather a tobacco shop with a terrible smell and a few magazines. Interesting definition for a bookstore.

Furthermore, Diest was actually historically significant - it is not just a random modern town. Namely, the Oranje-Nassaus were ruling it, and are ruling it to this very day: the Dutch king, Willem Alexander is actually the Baron of Diest. So clearly there was a story to tell and they even created a museum for it. But in the process, like at many other places, they forgot that people are not monks and they don't like to read codexes all day. So we did not have the patience to read the 50-page long guidebook and left the museum without much knowledge about Diest.

Aarschot, just a jump away from Leuven had similar attributes, but at least it had a nice main square without an army of cars, which is a rare view in Belgium. They even had a nice begijnhof and a 16th-century mill just at the bay, which gave finally some sense of belonging. And we saw also some local stores, however, the bakery already closes at 13:30, and the supposed patisserie is just a sweets shop with a bunch of chocolate and candies, a lighter version of the Americanized pink candy stores that are only visible in fake touristy places. So we did not end up finding some traces of culture there either. No wonder both towns were really empty and even if you saw people they were lacking any kind of spirit. Of course, there is nothing really in the towns. No social possibilities, no common spaces, no events, no inviting restaurant or café, and no charming route to take a stroll. So why would anyone bother to get out their shiny castle or modernist hypersuper block? They can just sit inside and enjoy their loneliness.

So it makes me really wonder why these municipalities are gaining numbers. Because "stadtflucht"  or suburbanization is a popular activity in Vlaanderen. Those, who can, want to leave the big cities and live an idyllic life in the smaller agglomeration. This is due to the miserable state of big cities in Western Europe - nobody really can enjoy living in these hubs which attract all types of people and cultures. So I can imagine the chaotic nature of Diest and Aarschot can not even be compared to giants like Antwerpen. But what is fascinating is that the new inhabitants of the suburbs do not want to take advantage of the suburbs, and thus I really miss the point why they even bothered to move there in the first place. How bad can the big towns be so that suburban people are willing to accept this kind of lifestyle? We shall see.
