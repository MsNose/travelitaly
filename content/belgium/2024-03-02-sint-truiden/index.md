Limburg is very different from the rest of the provinces, after all historically it was always separately handled. It is now a mix of post-industrial mining towns with decline and anger like Genk or Maasmechelen, while the southern parts with their fertile grounds in Haspengouw are hosting the traditional Christian farmers. Sint Truiden belongs to the latter.

It is the only town in Belgium that is named after its founder. Saint Trudo founded a church in the middle of nowhere in the early Middle Ages. And as it goes, during the following centuries more and more houses were built around the church, until the territory was big and influential enough to surround itself with walls and gain city rights. The town was originally under Metz and later was assigned to the Li√®ge. So one can feel the Wallon impact and the Maasland culture.

We were also lucky to experience the saturday market crowd, which filled up the whole gigantic market square and even the surrounding streets. They were selling the usual cheap clothes, special cheeses, and groceries, but on top of that there were also trucks with warm food. I don't mean hotdogs or fries or any other fast food, but real meals that you can get at a restaurant. This market attracted the whole town and everyone was bumping into other locals and had some casual heartwarming chitchat.

However, this beautiful and lively center was quite small compared to the population. But i guess this way they managed to preserve this golden part and make it completely pure. Needless to say, as a bishop town it had gorgeous churches. But as religion is losing its significance, they are promoting themselves rather as the fruit town. Namely, Sint Truiden is a big fruit producer, with apples and cherries being the most popular. The Jonagold apples are from them, so next time you buy them in the supermarket think of the great people of Sint Truiden. They are also using these fruits to make various products ranging from jams to beers. Even though according to the statistics it has a similar age demographic composition to other towns, we felt the large presence of the pensioner population of Sint Truiden. It was as if we opened a time capsule because everything seemed to be nice and in order. This is the agriculture-focused Catholic society that managed to survive also in Twente in the Netherlands, and these are some of the few places that are left somewhat untouched by the negative consequences of modernization and are still pleasant places to live.

Landen was an already smaller town, with one of those great flemish designs where the whole town was just one straight car road. Even though they are trying to promote themselves as "Landen - the countryside of Flanders", I was struggling to find the idyllic countryside. Their main square, if it can be called that way, was just a big parking lot with a city hall and a pub. It reminded me of Bastogne. Indeed, these towns are located close to the Walloon border and thus are aesthetically closer to the south. Moreover, Landen was already in Vlaams-Brabant, which was also tangible. No more humble Limburg.

Tienen was the bigger town. The town was a weird mix of Wallonia, Flanders, and the Netherlands. The bankrupt stores and both the nice and rotting houses were Wallon, the churches were Flemish and the roads were Dutch. It is so close to the Walloon border that we heard more French than Dutch. Tienen had a clear identity crisis which resulted in a rather messy experience.
