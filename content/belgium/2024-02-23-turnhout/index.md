The town has a 1 km long border with the Netherlands, but it feels like you are already on the other side. A modern business building is welcoming you at the station, which could be also in Tilburg or Eindhoven. There are bikes. A lot. Everywhere. From young to old from poor to rich everybody is cruising around with their bikes. And even bakfiets! And green. No, I do not mean weed, but trees, bushes, and grass giving a nice natural touch to the town. And water. The little bayes with little bridges remind you of the Dutch canals. And even the court, which is a literal castle is surrounded by water, like a medieval fort, or just simply the government building in Den Haag. The architecture changes. No more glass boxes sandwiched between 2 historical buildings. Only a nice balanced consistency. Much fewer bricks though, and more Rheinlands style. The white color gives a lighter elegant form. This mix is typical in Noord-Brabant. But what's typically Flemish is the begijnhof.
To put it simply, the begijnhof is a church surrounded by living houses in a special rustic bricky style. Originally these residences were made for the nuns who separated themselves from the rest of the society and created their own community around the church, but now it is the educated elite who move there due to the historical value and the holy beauty and calmness that the area is signaling. There are worse places to live. We could find these little gems in almost every Flemish town, but the one in Turnhout was a truly memorable experience.
