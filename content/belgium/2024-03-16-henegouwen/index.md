Everyone who arrives at the Brussels-Charleroi Airport knows that it is wise to leave the place as soon as possible. Charleroi is one of the perfect examples of a miserable Walloon cities. This city was the only thing that I saw before the trip to Hainaut, or in Dutch Henegouwen. As the biggest town in the province, I was afraid this was going to be the dominating trend everywhere. But to my surprise, the rest of Henegouwen is not just the nicest place in the French-speaking part; I found the towns and life here even better than by the northern husband.
 
They say that Belgium is a forced marriage between Wallonia and Vlaanderen, I always saw the thick division between the two parts. But this time, it was different. Henegouwen felt extremely Vlaams in its wealth and efficiency, and on top of this, it preserved a cultural family-friendly atmosphere, which is usually missing in the eastern part of Vlaanderen. And all of this, while having a big border with France. It became immediately clear that Henegouwen was something special; historically, next to Brabant, here was the rich elite concentrated, and this urban line between Kortrijk and Lille served as a heartland for the golden age.
 
  
### When is it for you CHIMAY the place to be?

{{< gallery dir="images/2024-03-16-chimay/" caption-position="none" />}}

- If  you want to buy a nice house in an isolated small town (there are a lot of empty gorgeous buildings advertised by the one real-estate company of the town)

- If you want to consume everyday delicious Trappist beer right from its source

- If you want to consume everyday cheese made out of delicious beer

- If you want to taste a wide range of local butters (i would recommend Beurre Ail des Ours)
 
If none of these points attract you I am afraid you will not need more than 5 minutes to visit Chimay. Regardless, it is a pleasant place, which is extremely rare in Wallonia. Not to mention that it is located at the very edge of Belgium, being 15 minutes away from the French town of Hirson. Luckily, I was prepared for some bad stuff, and this way I was not completely shocked that Hirson looked like an ideal place for a horror movie. After all, french people love to make their countryside towns miserable. That is what people need to keep in mind: Wallonia might be underperforming, but Wallons see, instead of the Flemish, the French as examples. And in this perspective, Chimay felt like a true paradise.
