The biggest city of Vlaanderen. The second biggest harbour in Europe. The diamond capital of the world. I would have not realized any of these things, because Antwerp looks like an average boring German town. This is strange because I expected it to be more similar to the Netherlands.

The train station is extremely gorgeous. It is one of those treasures from before the war that signals the magnificent power and virtues of a town. However, this impression disappears the minute you step out of the building. What is waiting for you is an army of trashy fast food stores, dysfunctional crossroads, and chaotic architecture from art nouveau to rotting metal blocks. This is not what pops into one's mind thinking of the diamond district - but the train station area is exactly it. Namely, the diamond logos can be seen everywhere, it is an extreme example of a specific market domination. So, I am not an expert, I got all of my knowledge from the diamond museum in the town. But it seems to me that diamonds are literally the most luxurious materials, they are worth insane amounts due to the complicated and professional process they go through, but also due to being the symbol of prestige. Therefore, as a naive and clearly uneducated person, I expected to find these stores in an elite, wealthy area with imperial buildings, red carpets, and security guards everywhere. Or, I guess the diamond store can be also placed between a Kruidvat and a McDonald's in a communist building, looking rather like a shady bazaar than an outstanding jewelry store. Although it is handy, after buying my discount toiletries and grabbing a cheeseburger I can quickly drop by the diamond store and choose some nice ring. At least that's what Antwerp thought.

And the diamond stores got even worse when I turned to a side street and saw flashing lights, advertising the current offers. I think the immigrant night shops are using the same LED lights. On top of that, there was even a plaza just for these stores. Needless to say, the building was outcompeted by the USSR architecture in Siberia. It was dirty, and rotting, the floor to the entrance was broken, and the cringe food smell was filling up all of the creepy corridors which rather felt like prison cells.

So this is supposed to be the diamond capital of the world? Who has even the stomach to go into any of these stores? I guess I will find out when I'm gonna be a millioner in desperate need of a diamond.

Clearly, the city government also realized that this diamond image can be attractive only as long as you actually don't see the stores. So now they are trying to push another field: fashion. Personally, I think fashion as the identity if a city is one of the weakest and most pathetic paths a town can choose. But what's even worse it is not even true! I haven't seen a single designer clothes store in Antwerpen, just the usual cheap mass-produced brands. Maybe I have to open my eyes wider.

Regarding the town, it has some nice spots. I mean 2. The cathedral and Grote Markt. Which are right next to each other. These are the only beautiful and pleasant places the town managed to preserve. Because creating new ones these days seems to be hard. It is not a coincidence that the pensioner lady in the propaganda video of The Antwerp Story exhibition said she really likes living here. She lives in one of those historical houses next to the market and her only activity is just going to the traditional pub in the square and drinking some nice local bears with her pensioner friends. Thus, she avoids all of the mess that is Antwerpen today and can live in this small bubble enjoying life. Smart woman.

### It is hard to imagine that in the 16th century, Antwerpen was THE PLACE TO BE.

The booming harbor town attracted all traders from Venice to London, where real estate prices were so high, that you could just be covered for your whole life as a landlord. Where the free markets were so successful and attractive that merchants even ditched Brugge just to get there. Where the finest and most delicate printing was done, where the translated Bibles were printed and sold on an insane scale. Where the liberal lifestyle was taking shape and men could even joke with unmarried women. Where a dense spy network was present because all of the valuable trade details and secrets of influential people.

That Antwerpen is gone. Now it feels like it has nothing. The harbor is still there, but the only thing it is famous for is being the drug capital of Europe. You don't wanna know how much drug got detected in the containers and then even how much they managed to smuggle. The confusion and loss of the city are just further supported by the supposedly right-wing mayor's enlightenment project. There are advertisement boards all around the town ordering us not to discriminate and not to be racist. Apparently, that's what you have to spend the money on as a mayor of a multicultural town.

Tip: if you want to see an attractive town, then take rather the book of Micheal Pye into your hands. The Antwerp he describes in his glory days is much more interesting. As he put it:
>" Antwerp was business, the city kept telling itself, and business was movement. Kill that life and that energy, and the city was nothing once again."
