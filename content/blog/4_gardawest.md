It seemed like a good idea to book a weekend holidays at Lombardy til its such a good weather. I was so hyped that I even forgot that I have an Italian exam on saturday


Luckily, one hotel was cancelable, but the other not. So not putting this money to waste, we decided to go the Lago Garda on friday, thus ditching my Italian course and then at 7 am on saturday I had to leave our lovely hotel to go to Milano, because it was exam time. Still, under these messy.  circumstances we try to make the most out of our idyllic lake holiday.


## Gargagno
We started with cruising around our bus change station in Gargnano. Needless to say when water is involved, you enter a different culture. Even the Garda is a lake in the mountains you immediately felt more Mediterranean. It is just even better, because you are constantly surrounded by the beautiful nature. There is nothing cosier than a constant hug from gigantic mountains. So actually, people do not have to try to make their town nice. No matter what they do they will have a gorgeous view. But still, even the towns are nice in their own way! They clearly have money there because there is not one cobbled stone being put in the wrong direction. And they have such lovely streets twirling in the legs of the mountains occasionally turning into real climbing challenges. The Cecilias there must be really in a good shape.


Gargnano did not look so special bit then you went down to the lake where there was a wooden corso decorated with blooming flowers. I mean I had worse walks. And guess why you also felt like you are in paradise. Because there were just rich tourist around you. You dont have to worry about a thing. Just about the fact that the lake is gonna get annexed by the Germans. It is no coincidence that the italians called Lago Tedesco-  the German lake. Its literaly flooded by them. So much, that even the menues are adjusted to them: you can get everything from Deutscher Caf√© to Bitburger. This was the first time that I saw in Italy a Birreria.But I am really wondering how can these people spend a whole week just lying on the beach and from time to time go eat a pizza or ice cream. I am craving for some more adventure.


## Riva del Garda
Riva del Garda, the most Northern part of the lake was a nice summer residence for Franz Joseph which he pointed out by building a gigantic villa there. Riva del Garda was already a different story. It was already in the autonomous region of Trentino, and you could really feel that autonomy. What beauty can be created of you just give the power to the local community to decide about their fate. I live it when a region is proud and they dare to out stickers on their products


## Limone
The historical roots are not that deep here, so instead, they have an alternative story. Limone sul Garda, as one can guess is famous for only one thing:limone. This town did not really exist until the 18th century when some cool guys had idea to grow lemons in Northern Italy, which is not really the ideal climate for the fruit with the harsher winters.  The miracle happened, and the lemons actually survived, and now thats their identaty. Like its crazy from the streets signs to chocolates, soaps and pizza plates everything is with lemon. But the most important is naturally the alcohol: limoncello! We were lucky to taste it at one of the shops-they dont really have any other shops than lemon shops - and it was delicious. So we could not resist and bought our own limoncello from Limone. And we even managed to step in to the lake for a while which was a great sensation to the feet with the stoney ground.
