We already payed a visit to Vercelli a few weeks ago. The commune has around 50000 inhabitants, so it is among the bigger guys in Piemonte. Regardless, you feel like you are in a cute countryside town.

The streets are not covered with the usual cobbled stones, but with just random disorganised stones, which gives a more natural atmosphere. And can you believe, the train station area is not hellish!  You actually feel safe. Everywhere. So, Vercelli already stood out from the very beginning. But it's when you meet the people that you realize that you entered the Weert of Piemonte (Weert is the most north western town of Limburg province in the Netherlands and even in this highly diverse country you were like what is up with Weert people why are they so cringely friendly). There are multiple things that put Vercelli on the unique towns list.


To begin with, a town of this size has multiple history museums, to which they actually invested money. Even with our greatest efforts we could not find anything about history in the noname cities like Genova or Milano. But in Vercelli you have to reserve a whole day if you want to visit every museum. This rich collection is naturally kind of a coincidence, since the museum was created during fascism to impress Mussolini during his visit to Vercelli. Since it was a more or less significant roman town, they felt the need the push the glorious history and even gathered a bunch of stuff from outside Vercelli and created rooms with the typical clean cold hearted fascist architecture.


But the Museum Leone was not only memorable for its unique founding story but for the whole functioning. There were 3 employees accompanying us in turns, all of them really engaging and having a broad historical knowledge about the collection. They were not really guides, they were just there to surveil us, because, there was no one else in the museum. I dont think they are getting visitors at all. In another museum we entered just 30 minutes before closing and got ticket number 001. But that was poor quality compared to Leone. They even had a fancy app that guided you through the museum! How can this museum be so unpopular with all these attributes? I mean we became best friends with one employee who apparently also will study in Torino and ended up chitchatting about school bureaucracy and exchanging phone numbers. A young lady employee got so hyped when we asked about the dialects in Piemonte I thought she will also ask for a number exchange too. And at some point a random Giovanni appeared in a room a performed a monologue about the hospitals in Vercelli. What an experience.


Despite all of the attention and materials that we got we were still not having a clear image about the history of Vercelli, but just getting through this whole procedure was priceless. Ending the day with walking through the main square filled with vibrant life of families and friends just contributed to the humbleness of the city.
