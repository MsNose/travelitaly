Biella is a really random place in Piedmont. It is terribly connected to other places and thus feels like a sleepy isolated forgotten land. The nearby Candello even has a completely intact medieval village which served as a temporary shelter for the people in case of invasion. Nobody bothered to destroy it. So there are some advantages. Fun fact: Would you have guessed that the trendy South-Korean clothing brand FILA is originally from Biella??
