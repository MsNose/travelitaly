If you look at the Garda lake on the map,it's pear shape is really apparent with the wide round south narrowing itself continuously into the mountain valley.

But if you take a closer look, this bottom part is not completely smooth. There is right in the middle a peninsula sticking into the lake, breaking the unity. This is Sirmione, which served as a great strategic point in the middle ages, considering the 360 degree view on the whole lake. The Della Scala family of Verona even built a gorgeous fort at the very end of the tail te ensure total control. Fun fact their name, Della Scala means literally "of the ladder", which is also depicted in their coat of arms, just a ladder with red background. I would assume if you want to be a noteworthy ruling family of a northern Italian city then you would have some elite-sounding name, but I guess that is just the rule for the French enlightened court. Maybe the Ladder family is trying to earn their prestige instead with their motto: "Nec descendere nec morari", which has the message "he who hesitates is lost", but actually means word by word "he who gets off shall die".  The Italian "scendere", getting off is especially used when you get off the bus, or get down from the ladder - which includes the beautiful symbolism of the family name. So basically if you get off the ladder you die. With this they definitely earned my respect for sure.


So the fort is pretty impressive. It's so rare to see such well preserved medical buildings with the typical water trench surrounding the zigzag walls, and a gigantic tower emerging in the middle of this, providing the bird view. It's fascinating to see that these complexes were built in a way so that no matter at what stage the enemy is in the siege, the defenders will have always superiority. This is embodies by the fortified harbour at one side, which prevents the fighters form potential starvation, or the well designed courtyard which is surrounded by the watching eyes of the archers from various hight levels. Even if the majority of the fortress is under siege, the defenders still have the upper hand in the main tower. Getting into that big stick is almost impossible and even if you manage to get inside, the stairs are designed so that when you come out of the whole you will be welcomed with spears pointing at all parts of your body. So, thanks to this insane architecture and engineering combined with isolation and a pinch of miracle, this special building has survived to this very day. Climbing up the walls, touching the centuries old stones and looking at the lake from above really makes you feel like you travelled back in time.

Obviously, what would this peninsula be without a luxurious roman villa! Even though the first impression was similar to Acquincum due to the ruins, the experience could have not been more different. First, there was no highway surrounding us with honking cars, just the lake and the olive trees which grow everywhere in the area. Second, it was a real posh life here with terazzos, lovely gardens and and five star hotel views, which made it easier to imagine how life was in those days. Although the quality of the museum was the same, probably in this case due to the overturistification. When your whole tiny island consists of tourist then why would you put effort into creating a good education service. Those people are anyways stupid and do not care about the history. They just want to eat their gelato for 12 euros (!), and since putting them through the misery of waiting five minutes in the line, how about we put the whole town full of gelaterias. But of course it's a bit tough competition if we put 10 stores right next to each other , so how about we create a cartell and agree on a really high price so that we can scam the stupid German tourists togather. They will buy it anyways! What a beautiful thing capitalism is.


So sadly, after all, these unique places like Sirmione can never survive as real town. Like every other place with rare treasures, it will be eaten up by tourists, and just feed itself from them, not ever reaching prosperity. Honestly, there is the lake, the beach, the olive trees, the villas, the history - but who would want to live in this fantasy filled with strangers?
