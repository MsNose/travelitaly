When arriving to the train station of Chivasso one would reconsider staying on the train and not getting out...

### Chivasso, Santhia, Novara

The station is a combination of ruins and ugly buildings. The expectations were not high. So when we actually entered the town and found ourselves in a lovely atmosphere with cute streets and nice people we were quite surprised. This town with around 30.000 inhabitants has everything one needs but with the charm of local communities. Big towns never can have the latter.


It is really fascinating to see that exactly like Asti, Chivasso is also 30 minutes away from Torino as the first station. And they are somewhat similar. But of course, while Asti is more elegant and well put together, in Chivasso you don't feel that people are rich. So it's rather a poorer Speyer.


It is incredibly satistfying to see many cafés with local pastry stores and even a menza full with locals!! And you can feel the pride by of the city by- wait for it- NOT destroying their historical cultural heritage. Crazy riiight?? They actually have kept the orginal walls of the fort and integrated it into the present living houses.


Also, it is really trendy for each town to have a patron saint. In Chivasso it's Beato Angelo Carletti di Chivasso. He was a popular theologian in his time in Piedmont ( casually studying law  in Bologna and hanging out with the next pope might have contributed to that). For me it seems that he was rather a political and bureaucratic figure being promoted to various roles during his carrier and solving international religious conflicts. The role of saints somehow changed from the early medieval times. Anyways, he was a cool dude, probably it will be hard to find someone like him today. I wish these monastic orders would still be such an essential part of life like in those days, because at least we we would have more people with purpose in life and not just rotting.


As in the case of the other regional train line, the further we got away from Torino, the more towns were loosing their spirit. Naturally, Santhiá with its 8000 inhabitants in the middle of nowhere is uncomparable. In Italy, towns of these size are the worst. It is already not small enough for each neighbour to know the other, but still not big enough to enjoy the non-necessary services and activities that give the soul.  Of course, there was a factory which is now rotting and empty. So it is just a sad dead town. Like all of the post industrial towns who did not figure out what to do with themselves. Then it is more worth it to have a 100 people village. At least they also got their own saint.


But how does then a 100 thousand people town look like? Novara is the second biggest town in Piedmont after Torino ( could there be centralization?). With its strategic geographical location being the crossing point of the Torino-Milano and the Genova-Switzerland lines it was meant to be a meeting point for trade. So no wonder that everyone wanted this town. From the Viscontis in Milano to the Savoys in Piedmont to Napoleon and the Habsburgs. So there were a few battles called the battle of Novara. This, it seems like the town did not really have time to breathe and create its own story. That is what you feel today. You clearly arrive to a rich polished place with beautiful buildings and churches, and there are people everywhere. Except there is no vibe. No engine that keeps the wheels of the city rolling. No cute cafès or restaurants, no local groceries, no astonishing piazzas. I want to take the last one back, because in fact, there are a bunch of little piazzas with gorgeous views- but there is just no room to take them in and not much is happening. So no wonder that the foreign groups could easily take over some parts. After all there was nothing really to defend. Or people with a a common purpose to fight and care.


So even though Novara was a much busier town, Chivasso felt more lively. Maybe this confusion in Novara also has roots in the constant switch between left and right mayors. Maybe by learning about Vercelli next time will help in understanding this line better.
