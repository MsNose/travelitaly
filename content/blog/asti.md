Just 30 minutes from Torino, the nest of the cultural elite can be found: Asti. There is always an event in Asti, whether it is wine, food, festival, market, it doesn't matter. And meanwhile it is the town of the Alfieri family who designed half of Piedmont, the arch enemy of Alba due to the same red Barbera wine they both make and the home of San Secondo. Not bad.
