I finally found the Maastricht of Italy. The cute university town with a gezellig atmosphere, cute stoned streets, glorious history and fulfilling liveliness.


Pavia is just 30 minutes from Milano, but somehow managed to avoid being this irritating dot sticking onto the city and providing living space for trashy people who just commute to the centre. Because, lets admit it, if you are a small town near Milano, the Milano influence is gonna be bigger than you want it to be. However, Pavia was ever since its existence a great refuser of Milanese rule and always wanted to be its own thing. Luckily, they were successful in achieving their goals and that is why it is still a nice town regardless of the proximity of Milano.

In fact, there is a great coherence in the southern lombard towns; they are all towns you actually can imagine living in. Bit the difference is that Mantova managed to be a Duchy and was further away, isolated from the up and downs and thus giving space for the blooming and them later preservation of the renaissance. Sadly, it was rare for Pavia to be left alone so the town differs in terms of architecture and city planning.

One would think that the current day cities gained their prominence in Roman time, which is true for most them. However, Pavia gained importance just after the fall of the Roman Empire, when the Ostrogoths made it their main seats along Ravenna and Verona. But clearly Pavia must have been their favorite because they choose the build the Palazzo Royale there, plus they also liked to crown their kings their. They mist have been quite sad when as a last stronghold of their kingdom, the Byzantines took it from them. Anyways, the byzantines did not have to wait much until the Lombards came and conquered all of northern italy. And what else would they have chosen as capital than Pavia! So as a residence of the ruling lombard kings and ideal location for assemblies it was also the place where the written laws of the Lombards got created. Naturally, this central position came along with great developments and population boom, so even though they were under Milanese rule from the start of their existence, Pavia kindly ditched Milan during the Lombard period because it would have been useless to go around with this pretending.

Since already two barbarian tribes put time and effort into building a nice capital, the invading Franks would have been stupid not to take advantage of it. Pavia became such a strong and rich place that even forged its own money. This wealth gave them the foundations to build the city from stones, bricks and limes which was really unusual. Thats why when you are there, you do not really get the typical italian vibes.

Regarding the later geopolitics during medieval times Pavia's strategy was pretty straightforward: ally with anyone who hates Milano.  And the one person who hated Milano the most was non other than the Holy Roman Emperor. This meant that while most of northern italy was forming a league against the Empire, Pavia joined the imperial forces. So this worked out until once noone showed up to save them from the Milanese occupation and had to surrender.

Its not like it was so terrible to be under Visconti rule. The Viscontis really idealized the lombard times, and did not wait much after the conquest to move their court from Milano back to the old capital. And along with it why not build a castle, churches, found monasteries and a university, and establish the versailles of italy with a gorgeous palace on the countryside at Certosa di Pavia. It was such a prosperous elite place that even the first jewish community managed to bloom without being deported of massacred! So the 14th century Pavia was definitely the place to be.

Afterwards it was bot that shiny because it was under constant attacks from the french, spanish, austrians and whoever felt like it. So the only thing that kept the towns soul alive was the uni which produced a lot of great intellectuals.

This cultural richness is still tangible today, with a lot of traditions, events, and nevertheless the cuisine. Additionally, Pavia is one of the rare towns in Italy situated next to a river. Since water in general has insane impact in forming civilizations and specific cultures and societies, it is no wonder that I put Pavia in the same box as Mantova and Cremona even though they have quite different history. Namely, the Ticino river, which crosses Pavia, is the offspring of the Po - which connects these 3 towns.
