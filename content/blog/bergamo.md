Brescia and Bergamo have basically the same structure: the lower modern city and the upper historical part. No wonder they are competing with each other. It is hard to decide which atmosphere is more  unpleasant though. Bergamo has some strange parts. Where poverty, uncaring and unsafety is dominating. It is closer to Milano, but is seems like it imported just the bad parts of the big city. Maybe that is why it was cheap to put an airport here - just like in the case of Brussels-Charleroi. But while in Charleroi it is hard to find anything impressive, Bergamo has some hidden gems.
