Milano. If you tell anyone that you are in Milano, the general reaction is "ooo, how lucky you are what a beautiful city!". Despite the fact the vast majority of people neither has seen a single photo of Milano, nor can point its location on the map. So how can they react like that? They just know the buzzwords like fashion and italian food, combined with great cheap plane connections that catches all eyes. And tadaaa, a prestigieus town is created.


Indeed, fashion is one of the pillars of Milanese lifestyle. Imagine a saturday evening. You would probably go out with your friends or family, have a lovely evening at a restaurant, party hard in a club, or just have some drinks at a nice terras. Milano people also have these things, but they are clearly shadowed by the fashion stores. Because the ideal saturday evening activity for the milanese is to shop clothes. I am not kidding, on the streets there are definitely more clothing stores than food stores, and they are so popular that you often have to stand in line just to enter the store! Forget the 17:00 closing time. The evening is the prime part of the day!


And honestly, the trattorias and pizzerias must be really hidden, because i did not see any on the walk through the city centre. Or at least any that had guests. Maybe they are outside the ring. Because, naturally, these are places that you go with your close friends and family. And metropolitan cities are not exactly ideal for a cosy homey celebrations. It is party time. Sorry, I mean shopping time. And this fashion obsession is not only present in Milano, but whole Lombardy. If I have to say one thing that connects all lombard towns, its that no matter how bad the town is, it will for sure have too many fashion stores with luxorious brands.


There are however the typical aperativo areas in Milano which are clean of fashion stores, and they are really giving you blick into the hip young city life. If you end up at the Porta Genova area canals you can even feel like as if you are in a poche Gracht in Amsterdam.


What is fascinating, how this modern trendy lifestyle meets the roman and medieval past. I dont think many people even know that Mediolanum (means "in the middle" due to its strategical location) was the capital of the Roman Empire for 120 years. Most of the precious ancient stuff was destroyed, but there are a few pieces, like the tower of the Circus Maximus or the facades of the Forum that gives you hints of the power and importance of this city. Moreover, it is incredibly hard to find  renaissance churches due to the conviction of baroque people that their enlightened architecture is superior, but in Milano we managed to find one. And what a beautiful world renaissance frescos are able to create.


The more nice areas I discover, the more I get it why the milanese love Milano.

There is something for everyone. Are you a nice rich couple with young children who are wearing suits already at the age of 6? Then there is fancy modern district built around ancient roman ruins where you can go and have a walk without any trouble, and just meet all of the other nice rich families. In a few minutes walk you can even be at a gorgeous shopping street with the most luxorious brands! It won't even be crowdy because it is really just for the rich-rich. So after buying a trendy shirt for 1000 euros at *comme des fuckdown* you can freshen up by eating a dick shaped waffle at mr.dick, and admire the roses on the wall organized in a shape of a vagina. What an amazing elite society life!


If you are a bit poorer, you can just have a 5 euro to go spritz and smoke some weed while sitting at one of the benches at the canal. If you want to have a more cultural you can have your aperativo at the brera district! If you want to escape societ you can just go to the Sforza castle and admire the piece of history untouched by modernity. If you want to be surrounded by an army of tourist you can go and enjoy the beautiful duomo. If you want to learn something, go to one of the amazing museums, like the Leonardo da Vinci or the National Science Museum. And these are just a few faces of Milano. So go have a look and choose what fits you best.
