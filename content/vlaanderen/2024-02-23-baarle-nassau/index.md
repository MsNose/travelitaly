This is a 7000 inhabitant municipality in the Netherlands. It would just be an average boring small town, however, it has something that I have never experienced before. Namely, this municipality is a border mess. There are 22 Belgian exclaves INSIDE the Dutch municipality. So a few dots on the map which are sometimes more consistent sometimes really isolated and random, are actually in Baarle-Hertog, a Belgian town. As a result of this, you can have a 5-minute walk and end up crossing the border multiple times.  They even made it clear on the pavement where exactly to borders lie. The stickers on the electric poles and the nation or provincial flags are also telling.

So clearly this proximity feeds the patriotic flames and suddenly it really matters whether the frituur is Belgian or Dutch. There is even a gigantic store made purely for beers from both countries. And a lot of tabac shops, which apparently have a cheaper offer in Belgium. It is also visible that the architecture on Dutch land is the pre-factory style due to the stricter regulations and the fact that it is cheaper to buy an already-made plan from building companies than create your own idea. On the contrary, Belgians have more freedom to express themselves in their building styles.
Another fascinating thing was that the way to Baarle-Nassau was a 2.0 of our ride from Boxtel to Tilburg. These bus rides in the countryside with the gorgeous farms, villas, and forests are quite admirable. And the similarities in the two countries were obvious. It is the same structure, style, and culture. No wonder that Antwerpen province is the big bastion for Flemish nationalism and the big supporter of unification with the Netherlands. Of course, they want to be rather with the Dutch than the Wallons, the towns and villages in Antwerpen province look literally Dutch! Thus the question arises whether it should be just this province that should belong to the Netherlands, since in other provinces the Dutch influence was much weaker or almost nonexistent. So there is already too much diversity in Vlaanderen to say that the whole thing should join the northern neighbour. But no wonder that all of the major political players campaigning for this unification are from this area.
