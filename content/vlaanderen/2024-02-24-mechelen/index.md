The centrum of Vlaanderen. The first real capital was established by Philip the Good during the Burgundian golden age. Thus the home of many politicians who were members of the Great Council. The residence of Margaret from Austria and his nephew, the to-be Charles the V. The meeting point of the Golden Fleece. This cult consisted of the 30 biggest powers in Europe and was meant to protect Christianity and maintain authority. The fact that the Burgondians created this knight order is highly significant since it put the dukes to the same level as the kings of France. But all of these happenings there did not seem strong enough to keep the city from destroying itself.

The city is today messy, and anarchic, and it is destroying its historical charm with the ugly destructive modern buildings and the high share of immigrants who seem to be having a hard time with integration. When a city has this kind of characteristic, they have usually two voting scenarios: they either have an angry vote to express their dissatisfaction with the current situation or the two ends of society separate themselves, act as if everything is perfect, and vote liberal or green. Mechelen is the latter type. So, naturally, this means that people prefer to live in bubbles. This is quite interesting because apparently, the mayor got the World Mayor prize for his amazing achievements in welcoming and integrating refugees and making Mechelen a wonderful town. I just saw sad streets, soul-lacking historical squares, and an incredibly woke museum where during the historical ride of Mechelen the crimes of the Congo were pushed into our faces, not talking about depicting Margaret from Austria as a black woman and showing some global examples of art in the middle of the burgondian exhibition. This is Mechelen, the first parliament of the Low Countries. It should have stayed in those times and never escaped it.
