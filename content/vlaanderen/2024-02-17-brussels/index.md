Brussels. The capital of the historical Brabant. The capital a the BurgondiÃ«rs, the founding father of the Low Countries. The capital of Europe. What a disappointment.
I had already had multiple encounters with Brussels, so it had many opportunities to impress. But somehow this historically significant town, starting as a trading point and developing into the residence of the elite, has lost all of its charm. The EU institutions, where all of the big guys are deciding about the fate of the EU, are nothing more than depressing ugly metal and glass building blocks, surrounded by awkward silence. Only the cars can be seen and heard. Thus, this dead and sad part really is an ideal place for crime. It is hard to have a day without news headlines reporting a stabbing, bombing, or burning in Brussels. So I am really wondering how the Eurocrats can survive being there most of the time.

There is only one part of Brussels that remained completely intact from the brusselization: La Grande Place. Otherwise the whole gorgeous town was completely destroyed by Louis XIV, le roi du soleil,  and the rebuilding project was not fancied for the remainder of the town. So unsurprisingly, all the tourists were squeezed into this square, while the rest of the city was deserted. Except of course the Manneke-Pis. Luckily the statue of the peeing little man is placed on the top of the fountain so this way we could spot it from further away. Because you could not really get close to the statue- it was flooded by tourists taking pictures of it. I am really wondering whether knew anything about the significance of this piece of art or were just like "Look he is peeing with his little wiener haha". Probably the latter. This statue is a real symbol of Brussels. Although it was not really worth even mentioning for a really long time. It became the center of attention only after the bombardment of the city when as a way to make fun of the French king a satyrical text was distributed, choosing the Manneke-Pis as a spokesperson of the people of Brussles. As a response, the French soldiers tried to steal the statuette so to prevent a potential uprising in Brussels Louis XV decorated the statuette in a fancy nobleman's costume as a sign of apology. And this is the start of a very important job: to this very day there is a 'dresser' of the Manneken-Pis who decorates the statuette for all kinds of occasions. There is even a store with all of the outfits that the boy already had. My favorites are the traditional clothes of EU countries but the Italian carabinieri uniform also caught my eye. So this little man is the symbol of the Brussels spirit and shows that back in those days they still had humor. There is not much to laugh about in Brussels today. Because even these two tourist hotspots were facing rotting bankrupt houses. It seems they also have difficulties with putting trash into the trashcan. No wonder that the center is still having an unpleasant atmosphere and attracts suspicious people. So of course the visitors have to flee to Beer World, an interactive "museum" about Belgian beer history to find some relief.

And you can forget about having a normal conversation in Dutch with any employee. This town, which was for centuries the center of Dutch-speaking territories and is still inside Vlaanderen, is completely colonized by the French language. This switch started with the french speaking elite moving to the capital, and now you can't even find a Dutch language book in a boomstore. Not even on the sqaure of the Flemish parlament! While Dutch is shrinking, next to French other languages are also becoming dominating, due to the multicultural society that was created in this mess. As a result, Brussel hates Vlaanderen and Vlaanderen hates Brussels. At least the feelings are mutual. I have never seen such an unremarkable city. It is supposed to be not just the "only real big city in Belgium", but also the HQ for European unity. Of course, the eurocrats lose connection to the world they have to be in a completely closed bubble not to experience the horrors of the real Brussels.
