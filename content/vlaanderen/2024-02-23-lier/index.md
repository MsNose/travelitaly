Lierke Plezierke - Fun little Lier. That is the nickname of the town. Indeed Lier is a really pleasant town, maybe that is why even Johanna from Castilia was motivated enough to ditch Spain and come here to the Low Countries for her wedding with Filip the Schone. That was not a usual choice, because the weddings of the royal family were held always in the homeland, in Spain. But the wedding in Lier with the Burgundian celebration manners are not something to miss out on. The party must have been really successful since as a result Charles V. was born, who became a somewhat important person in the history of the Habsburgs.
The other nickname of the Lierenaars is "schapenkoppen" literally sheepheads. This comes from the legend that when they had the opportunity to choose between having a university or a cattle market as a privilege, they chose the latter. The reaction of the duke was 'Oh, these sheepheads'. You can still see the sign of this identity in-store decorations and flags in the city. They are proud of their choice. They even have their own beer, Caves, which can be bought at pubs in Lier. It is truly exceptional, I have never tasted such a special beer. Moreover, they have even an EU-protected dessert: the Liers Vlaaike. Before imagining something fundamentally innovative, it has to be mentioned that we are in the Low Countries. So the Liers vlaaike was nothing more than a teeny-tiny ontbijtkoek dough in a thin pastry basket. At least their serving style is creative I guess.
What is also remarkable, is that the difference between Antwerpen and the other provinces is really visible. Namely, Antwerpen is the only province not bordering Wallonia. The only neighbor is the Netherlands, and it can be immediately felt that the Dutch influence is way stronger here than in Limburg. And the more north we went, the stronger this influence got. The way to Turnhout could have been just a casual trip in Noord Brabant.
