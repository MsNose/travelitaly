### Verba volant, scripta manent.

"(spoken) words fly away, written ones remain."

During my Erasmus semester in Northern Italy I collected many beautiful memories. I managed to discover 4 regions: Piedmont, Lombardy, Liguria and Aosta. I have learned a couple of things:

> The sentence "I've been to Italy" can have radically different meanings depending on which part you visited

> The quality of food lies in the quality of the ingredients (and you should not use a lot of them)

> Being surrounded by beauty is a quintessential part of a healthy and satisfying life

> No matter how hard you try, the openness and spirit of the Italian people will definitely take you over

> Practicing Italian is the easiest thing: you can never create an awkward situation, no matter your language skills.

> 'Un cafè per favore' is the most useful sentence. Under cafè they mean espresso. That is the true coffee. Btw drinking milky coffee after lunch is CRIMINAL.
