Liguria is just a jump away from both Piemonte and Lombardia. Still you enter a totally different planet. The way people fro.t eh above mentioned regions describe Ligurian people as weird, rude, closed up, and the main word they associated with Genova was stinky.


Although there was one place that everyone fanatically recommended: le cinque terre. If you look at the map you don't see much, just a tiny pinnencula a the most eastern part of Liguria which is slightly more hilly than the coasts elsewhere. You also see the sign that it is a national park-a protected area. So you would think ahaaa the reason why it is so hyped is because nature in the form of mountains and see combined with cute little villages. Okay. But there must be something else. Because everyone is so obsessed and wants to go there. And not to any other part of Liguria which has kind of the same characteristics. So our biggest challenge during our tour was to find out why is that.


We ended up with the following conclusions: first, it is completely protected from modernity: there is just simply no place there in the mountains to extend the town. They use all the fertile areas of the mountains to grow grapes. ( otherwise what expensive wine would the tourists drink.) So, with this geographical position the territory managed to be stuck in time, thus creating a perfect escape of out terrible contemporary cities.


Second, it attracts 3 kind of demographics: the beach persons, the hiking persons and the Asians. The beach persons just want a really uniquely beautiful clear water with a mountain view - but you can actually get that anywhere in Liguria so I don't get it why it is better being squeezed into a tiny place on cliffs. The hiking persons can choose from multiple themed paths like churches or vine varying in difficulty.  But of course the nice path, which does not consist of literal climbing but is a rather an intensive stroll, is not free. Yes, you have to pay to cross. So that you can experience constant traffic jams with anglosaxans.


I still did not figure out why the 3rd demographics, the asians come here. They are neither beach nor hike persons. They are clearly suffering in the heat with their long pants and hoodies and are not willing to do anything else but take pictures of every corner. They even broke the wooden stick that you get with the fried fish into two, so that they can eat the fish with chopsticks!!! There is even an easy path created for them:a passage going along the lower part of the mountain without any ups or downs. So, literally a bridge on the side of the mountain instead of climbing through it. But if they are really lazy and impatient they can just take the boat which drives them through the whole thing!

Therefore, the third reason why the cinque terre is so hyped, is just because of the good marketing. They are pushing into your face that this a special place clearly not just in Europe, but also in Asia and America. And when you advertise a place so much that it becomes internationally well known, then it doesn't really matter what the actual place can offer, the fame is enough. 



None of these reasons convinced me to enjoy the stay there. All of the natural beauty is killed by the tourists who invaded the lands. I could have not imagined that there is anything fuller and more miserable than the milanese metro - until I experienced traveling with the train on the 5terre. They already charging these tourist 18 euros a day to use these 5 stops but this still doesn't seemed to be enough to keep the train from being like a sardine can. You really can't get a break to appreciate your surrounding. The restaurants are so busy and unbearable to work at that only persons who have really low standards are willing to take it. Even if I spoke in Italian to the waitress, she answered in English. It reminded me of the Netherlands.



Honestly, I enjoyed more going to Porta Venere, a cute coast 20 minutes away from La Spezia. You still get the wide range of restaurants, the mountains and the sea - but on top of that you even get a medieval fortress, churches and locals! Ending our day at Porta Venere was such a relief, a true liberation from the constant pressure of the 5terre. Of course, you cannot find any of these gems inside la Spezia-the city is a natural harbour, which means that just like Genova, it has no beaches to enjoy. Instead, the town is just completely taken over by foreign communities. The only way you can be immune to this is by living in a cute district like Marola, where our accommodation was. It was literally up on the hill and you had to use narrow stairs and passages to navigate through the densely built top area. These tiny streets were occasionally interrupted buy a small square with benches and a nice view serving as a great meeting or chilling place for the inhabitants. It was mostly old people living there and it seemed like everybody knew each other. It was truly heavenly.


There was no other way to end this holiday then to go to the beach and have an aperativo.

So the moral of the story is that don't trust the cliche stuffs and just follow your own instincts. Unless you have low standards. Then the cinque terre is perfect for you.
