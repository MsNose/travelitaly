La Granda. That's the nickname of the Provincia di Cuneo. It is not because it sooo great - it has just the biggest territory.


And somehow the rest of Piemonte always makes fun of this province. When I was at the bike store in Torino having a chitchat with the owner about whether it is safe to bike in the city, he said "Yes, here it is okay, just dont go to Cuneo they drive like crazy!" Moreover, once I was listening on a train to 2 university students who accidently bumped to each other and apparently they were form Cuneo. As a consequence, during the whole 2 hour ride they were gossiping about the happenings in the town, but mostly about people. It seemed like they know everybody. And on top of that, they are the hardcore leftwing bastion of the region, voting differently for a really long time. So that also shows that the Cuneesi experience life in a different way.

To put it simply, Cuneo is a mix of Piemonte and Liguria. No wonder, since the valley from Cuneo leads to Ventimiglia, one of the big towns in Liguria. So, you see a lot of painted houses and town is really sleepy. But sometimes it has the piemontese charm with some imperial architecture and galleries. But we realized in the beginning that the streets are way to straight and planned. Indeed, Cuneo has really strange city planning. Most towns are naturally ina form of a circle. However, Cuneo is on a hill and the options are limited so it ended up being a weird long triangle. Actually thats where its name is coming from. But its really unnatural and the fact that you are surrounded by the beautiful Alps but cant see them, does not help the situation. But they have definately the nicest churches in Piemonte. Its still barroque but at least it is a more sophisticated elegant version which does not make me wanna puke.

After Bra and Alba, which are both in Cuneo, I expected more from the capital. But when you look at their history, nothing is that surprising. Namely, Cuneo has not much history. It has the fate of the mountain valley little towns which were constantly switched between the dominant powers in the area. For Cuneo this meant that it was throughout the hundreds of years under Saluzzo, Asti, Milano, France, the Savoys and who knows how many more. While these neighbours had kings, dukes and Marques who controlled their territories, cuneo was just consisting of merchants and farmers and never stood a chance against the big players. So that is why it is so empty.
Therefore, we decided to go for an adventure to Saluzzo. After all, Saluzzo was the biggie throughout history, so it must have some story to tell. But for that, we had to take an extraurban bus. And what I have learned throughout my stay, is that if you want to have a reliable trip, you should never take the bus. The fact that the first bus that we wanted to take did not show up, just proved this. But for some reason the next one was on time, so we successfully arrived to Saluzzo. And indeed, it was much more piemontese with the cute stoney streets and rustic houses. It had the fourth of the population of Cuneo and it was a terrible foggy weather, but still the town felt 10 times more alive. And also, richer. So this was a lively place to do all the shopping and pack out bags full with local specialties.
